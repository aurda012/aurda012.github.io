<p>I’ve always been a builder and a dreamer.  I remember putting together beautiful city architectures out of playbacks in my kindergarten class, while my classmates was busy sucking boogers out of his nose through a bendy-straw. That’s when I knew I was different.  I want to know it all, but I have to conquer one thing at a time. I like cars, too. I took up coding as a hobby but I decided to make it my career.</p>
